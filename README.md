Le Wagon Bootcamp Challenge on Week 6, first day on Ruby On Rails

Objective: We will implement a simple Rails application with 2 pages:

    First page is a form with an input, where a user can type a question to ask the Coach
    After submitting the form, the user is redirected to a new page where she/he will see her/his question and the coach answer.

Specs:

Get familiar with Rails command line basics. For this exercise, you should know at least how to:

    Create a new Rails app
    Launch a web server to test your app locally
    Generate a new controller from the command line
    Check your routes with the relevant rails command
